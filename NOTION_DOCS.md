# Vela Notion Documentation System

## Overview

Your Vela project now has an **automated documentation workspace in Notion** that updates whenever you commit code. This system helps you stay oriented with what's happening in the project, even if you're not technical.

## What's in Your Notion Workspace

Your Notion page (https://notion.so/3088414f7d9b80cc855ad59086a39823) contains:

### 📋 Overview
Plain-English explanation of:
- What Vela does
- How the signal logic works
- Current assets covered
- System architecture
- Glossary of technical terms

### ⚡ Quick Reference
Your dashboard for:
- Key links (Supabase, GitHub, deployment URL)
- Current signal parameters (EMA, RSI, etc.)
- Asset coverage
- Data refresh intervals
- Quick commands and file structure

### 🎨 Design System
Visual design decisions:
- Color palette (green/red/grey for signals)
- Typography standards
- Component patterns
- Spacing and layout rules
- Icon usage

### 📊 Product & Business
Strategic context:
- Product vision
- Target users
- Success metrics (win rate, accuracy)

## Databases (Your Living Records)

### 📝 Changelog
Every code change automatically creates an entry here with:
- **Summary**: One-line description
- **Detail**: Plain-English explanation
- **Area**: Signals / Data / UI / Infra / Risk controls
- **Impact**: User-facing / Internal / Breaking
- **Date**, **Version**, **Status**

### 🧭 Decisions
Log important choices you make:
- Why you picked certain parameters
- Which approach you chose and why
- What alternatives you considered
- Current status (Active / Replaced / Deprecated)

### ✅ Tasks & Roadmap
Kanban board for tracking work:
- **Backlog**: Ideas and future work
- **Next**: Your current focus (3-5 items)
- **In Progress**: What you're actively working on
- **Blocked**: Stuck items
- **Done**: Completed work

### 🎨 Design Decisions
Track visual and UX choices:
- UI/UX patterns you standardize on
- Color and typography choices
- Layout decisions
- Accessibility considerations

### 📅 Content Calendar
Manage all written content:
- Brief templates
- Notification copy
- Help text
- Error messages
- Marketing copy

## How the Automation Works

### Git Hook Magic
Every time you (or Claude) makes a git commit:

1. **Post-commit hook fires** (`.git/hooks/post-commit`)
2. **Python script runs** (`scripts/git_to_notion.py`)
3. **Claude API analyzes** the git diff and commit message
4. **Notion entry created** with plain-English summary

This means **zero manual work** - just commit your code normally and your Notion updates automatically!

### What Gets Analyzed
The script sends to Claude:
- Commit message
- List of changed files
- Git diff (what actually changed)

Claude then generates:
- **Summary**: Short one-liner (under 80 chars)
- **Detail**: 2-4 sentences explaining the change
- **Area**: Which part of the system (Signals, UI, Data, etc.)
- **Impact**: Who cares about this change

### Skipping Automation
If you want to commit without updating Notion, start your commit message with `[skip-notion]`:

```bash
git commit -m "[skip-notion] WIP: testing something"
```

## How to Use This System

### Daily Workflow

1. **Open Notion** - Your Vela page is your central reference
2. **Check Changelog** - See what changed recently
3. **Review Tasks** - Move cards through your kanban board
4. **Code with Claude** - Make changes, commit normally
5. **Notion auto-updates** - Your changelog populates automatically

### When Making Decisions

When you change something significant (signal parameters, data sources, UI patterns):

1. Go to **Decisions** database
2. Add a new entry:
   - **Decision**: "Changed RSI threshold from 40 to 35"
   - **Why**: "Too many false signals in choppy markets, narrower threshold filters better"
   - **Alternatives**: "Tried ADX filter but it was too restrictive"
   - **Status**: Active

This prevents you forgetting why you made choices 6 months later!

### End of Coding Session

After working with Claude, you can optionally ask:

> "Summarize what we changed today and update the Notion Decisions if we made any important choices."

Claude will help you capture anything the git hook might have missed (like strategic decisions vs. code changes).

### Tracking Design Changes

When you change colors, layouts, or component styles:

1. Go to **Design Decisions** database
2. Log the change:
   - **Decision**: "Use left-border color instead of card background for signal cards"
   - **Category**: UI/UX
   - **Why**: "Better accessibility, cleaner visual hierarchy"
   - **Status**: Active

### Managing Content

When adding or changing user-facing text:

1. Go to **Content Calendar** database
2. Add the copy:
   - **Content**: "Bullish signal notification template"
   - **Type**: Notification
   - **Copy**: "🟢 {ASSET} turned green: {REASON}"
   - **Status**: Live

## Configuration Files

### `.notion-config.json`
Contains your Notion integration credentials and database IDs. **DO NOT commit this to git** (it's in `.gitignore`).

```json
{
  "notion_token": "ntn_...",
  "vela_page_id": "...",
  "changelog_db_id": "...",
  "decisions_db_id": "...",
  "tasks_db_id": "...",
  "design_decisions_db_id": "...",
  "content_calendar_db_id": "..."
}
```

## Scripts

All automation scripts are in `scripts/`:

- `setup_notion.py` - Initial workspace creation (already ran)
- `populate_overview.py` - Adds Overview content (already ran)
- `add_quick_reference.py` - Adds Quick Reference (already ran)
- `add_design_and_product.py` - Adds Design/Product/Content/Ops sections (already ran)
- `add_initial_changelog.py` - Adds first changelog entries (already ran)
- `git_to_notion.py` - **The main automation** (runs on every git commit)

## Customization

### Adding New Sections
To add more sections to your Notion page, create a new script following the pattern:

```python
import json
import requests

with open('.notion-config.json', 'r') as f:
    config = json.load(f)

# Add blocks to config['vela_page_id']
```

### Changing Changelog Categories
Edit `git_to_notion.py` and modify the `create_simple_entry()` function's area detection logic.

### Adding New Databases
Use the `create_database()` function pattern from `setup_notion.py` and save the new database ID to `.notion-config.json`.

## Troubleshooting

### Notion not updating after commits
1. Check that `.git/hooks/post-commit` is executable: `ls -l .git/hooks/post-commit`
2. Run manually: `python3 scripts/git_to_notion.py`
3. Check for errors in terminal output

### Claude API errors
- Verify `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` is set: `echo $ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`
- Check API credits at https://console.anthropic.com
- System falls back to simple parsing if API unavailable

### Notion API errors
- Verify your integration has access to the Vela page
- Check token is valid in `.notion-config.json`
- Re-share the page with the integration if needed

## Tips for Non-Technical Owners

### When Claude mentions file paths
Look them up in **Quick Reference → File Structure Cheat Sheet**

Example: "I updated `src/hooks/useData.ts`" → Check Quick Reference → "Data fetching: src/hooks/useData.ts"

### When Claude uses jargon
Check **Overview → Glossary** for definitions

Example: "I changed the EMA cross logic" → Glossary → "EMA (Exponential Moving Average)"

### When you want to understand a change
Go to **Changelog** and filter by **Area** or **Date**

Example: "What changed in the UI last week?" → Changelog → Filter Area = UI, Date = last 7 days

### When deciding what to build next
Use **Tasks & Roadmap** to organize:
- Dump all ideas in **Backlog**
- Prioritize 3-5 items to **Next**
- Work on one at a time in **In Progress**
- Move to **Done** when complete

## Next Steps

1. **Bookmark your Notion page**: https://notion.so/3088414f7d9b80cc855ad59086a39823
2. **Test the automation**: Make a small code change, commit it, check Notion
3. **Start adding tasks**: Populate your Tasks & Roadmap with upcoming work
4. **Log your first decision**: Add an entry when you make your next important choice

Your documentation is now a living system that grows with your project! 🎉
